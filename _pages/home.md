I'm a prospective PhD student looking for opportunities in the areas of parasitology, immunology and microbiology. 

I previously received both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees from the [Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS)](http://ufrgs.br) under prof. [Tiana Tasca](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F0M_OOQAAAAJ), at the Trichomonas Research Group Laboratory (GPtrico). During my master's I studied [biomarkers and therapeutic targets in purinergic signaling for Trichomonas vaginalis](assets/bibliography/msc-thesis.pdf), and my research was funded by the national [CAPES scholarship](https://www.gov.br/capes/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/bolsas), which is awarded to selected candidates with excellent academic performance. Previously, for my bachelor's thesis I studied the [anti-Trichomonas vaginalis activity of Brazilian brown propolis](assets/bibliography/tr-propolis.pdf). 

I'm generally interested in the areas of parasitology, immunology and microbiology. I'm also interested in:
  * host-parasite interactions
  * purinergic signaling
  * neglected tropical diseases
  * cancer research
